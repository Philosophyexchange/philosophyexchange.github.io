2) Provide feedback to one other person's paper when contacted by our team. This can be written or via video, as decided amongst yourselves.

3) Once you have provided feedback, wait to receive feedback from two individuals within one week's time. Our team will work with submitters to ensure adequate feedback is provided to you.

That's it! Your paper will be of higher quality because of this exchange process.
