The mission of **Philosophy Exchange** is to...

**Contribute** to an exchange of ideas and abstracts,
**Encourage** individuals to benefit from each other’s expertise and knowledge,
**Grow** a global community of postgraduate students and young professionals.

**Contribute today. Encourage tomorrow. Grow together.**

**Philosophy Exchange** was brought to life by a group of likeminded London School of Economics (LSE) MSc Philosophy students. Throughout our time at the LSE we faced many professional and personal challenges. By facing these challenges together as a community, we were able to support each other and to help each individual reach their maximum potential. We now want to give this feeling of community and mutual support to the subsequent generations of LSE MSc Philosophy students.

**Philosophy Exchange** is a place for learning which is free and open to all. The society benefits from the diversity of experience and knowledge that members of all stages of learning bring to the community. We welcome you to join our growing community of young professionals. We appreciate your interest and are curious to see what you can teach us today, tomorrow and in the future.

Our community is centered around some basic egalitarian values. We offer you a safe intellectual space that
welcomes philosophers from all backgrounds
cherishes all members ideas and recognizes their originality
respects the intellectual property of others
aims to cater to the needs of every member equally
encourages a community-driven and non-competitive environment
provides constructive feedback which helps others to improve their work
welcomes and encourages feedback from others and uses it to improve the community

We look forward to working with you!
