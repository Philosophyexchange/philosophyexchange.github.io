Thick concepts have been argued to introduce ‘fact-value inseparability’ into science, specifically because they are not extensionally equivalent to any non-evaluative terms. On the existing clearly articulated definition – according to which it occurs whenever ostensively ‘factual’ claims in fact require ethical justification - thick concepts clearly do introduce such inseparability, but they do so independently of the extensional inequivalence thesis.

I conceptualize evaluative (fact-value) separability, roughly speaking, as the practical ability, without sacrificing excessive accuracy, to separate a research conclusion into one claim placing an object into a non-evaluatively described reference-class, and another evaluating that reference-class. I consider, in light of the extensional inequivalence thesis, how thick concepts impact this kind of evaluative-separability. I argue that such evaluative-separability is a worthy scientific ideal because it has explanatory value, and can facilitate scientific inquiry which, in a sense I articulate, is ‘evaluatively-autonomous’, which may in turn facilitate accurate inquiry and trust in science.
