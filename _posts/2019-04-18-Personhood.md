In modern political philosophy, some are utilizing a notion of the person that is incomplete. This is the notion of performativism. Such authors argue for a performative notion rather than an intrincisist notion, suggesting that persons are agents capable of having demands made upon them, and of making reciprocal demands in turn, within a system of norms. However, in this paper I will first explain the intrincisist and performative perspectives before noting that a gap in the philosophical literature exists between the performative and intrincisist perspectives. From here, I will introduce the Aristotelean notion of substance. Finally, I will argue that this notion of substance is appropriate in filling the gap between the performative and intrincisist perspectives. I will conclude by responding to two objections.
