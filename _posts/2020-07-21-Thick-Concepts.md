In this article the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s methodology for detection and attribution of climate change is evaluated. The discussion of the measuring methodologies highlights the use of incongruous assumptions between the detection and attribution tests, bringing their compatibility into question. I argue the incompatibility leaves the existing methodology unable to fulfill the epistemic purposes of these studies and an improved methodology is required. A new definitional methodology is outlined and if inserted into the existing methodology will dispel the problem with the incongruous assumptions while also providing increased epistemic access during detection and attribution studies.
