Psychometricians fail to rationalize a certain methodological decision if they are not able to provide justification for all hypotheses relevant to that methodological decision. The baseline assumption that must be justified by all psychometricians (though not the only) is the acceptance of the quantifiability hypothesis â€“ the hypothesis that psychological attributes are indeed quantifiable (QH). If psychometricians fail to provide justification for accepting QH, they ultimately fail to rationalize their methods. Furthermore, I claim that it is not possible to empirically justify the acceptance of QH if one is not also an ontological realist. Only those theories that harbor ontological commitments succeed in providing the necessary justification for the assumption that the measured entities are indeed quantifiable. Psychometricians cannot rationalize her methods if she fails to provide justification for accepting QH (i.e. fails to satisfy MER). She can only provide said justification if she employs measurement models which presuppose ontological realism.
