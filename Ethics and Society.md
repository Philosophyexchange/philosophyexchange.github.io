## Open Borders
In this paper, I question from an egalitarian perspective whether states hold as much authority to restrict immigration as recent arguments by Wellman and Miller suggestion. I first examine the moral arbitrariness problem of the 'natural lottery', noting individuals have strong rights to free movements from an egalitarian liberal perspective.  I then examine two recent arguments by Wellman and Miller. However, I find these arguments insufficiently compelling. Absent stronger arguments, I conclude such restrictions are unjust given the arbitrariness problem presented by the 'natural lottery' argument.
