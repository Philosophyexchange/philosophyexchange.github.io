Economics and economists take prominent roles in the process of social (and obviously economic) policy decision making. The question whether economists can be responsible for the outcomes of such policies has been highly debated. In cases, where an economist is directly involved in the policy process, the answer seems to be a somewhat straightforward ‚yes‘. However, whether economists qua scientists have any responsility is much more disputed. In this project, it is proposed that economists act as choice architecture to policy makers with regards to the economic tools might evaluate policies. The preliminary goal is to define a minimum amount of influence of economists qua scientists on policy decisions and to discuss whether this implies any responsibility for economists.
