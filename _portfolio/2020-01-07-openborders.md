In this paper, I question from an egalitarian perspective whether states hold as much authority to restrict immigration as traditional arguments suggest. I first examine the moral arbitrariness problem of the “natural lottery”, noting individuals have strong rights to free movement from an egalitarian liberal perspective. I then examine two traditional arguments that defend restrictions on immigration – what I will call the “Freedom of Association” argument and the “Limited Resources” argument. However, I find these arguments insufficiently compelling. Absent stronger arguments for immigration restriction, I conclude such restrictions are unjust given the arbitrariness problem presented by the “natural lottery” argument.
