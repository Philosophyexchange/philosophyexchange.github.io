title: "To Do"
excerpt: "This is a list of tasks that must be done prior to launch"
---

1. Expand on the 'about section'
--> Describe how it is egalitarian

2. Add comments system so individuals can comment on their posts

3. Add a section on security
--> e.g. explain why people would want to submit their abstracts anonymously
--> the risk is that somebody might steal the Ideas
--> offer a train of secured details to ensure that if an idea is stolen then the idea could be traced with appropriate history per the Website

4. At the core of the project is this idea that just because people are not professionally engaged in idea creation as academics, it does not mean that this same project might not be carried out. Further, we can assist others through this type of feedback

5. Develop a platform of values/beliefs.
--> e.g. transparent, egalitarian, etc.
--> Aim of the website is not publicity; it is to exchange Ideas
--> Goal is to address the weaknesses in dissertations and journals e.g. they are not polished enough, they don't address a specific problem, they aren't clear in the argument

6. Develop a platform for individuals to share their 3-minute ideas.


7. Add Google analytics to the Website
--> Track page views and locations


8. Andrea to send out emails
1) Andrea to post on facebook

--> Have broad topics
--> Have a tag -- e.g. this has been resolved, this has been relieved
