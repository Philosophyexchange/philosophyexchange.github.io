Philosophy Exchange was born out of a need to fill a gap in modern academia.

Historically, the university was constructed to instruct scholars on the process of independent research. This took place in the form of regular tutorial lessons and meetings with supervisors. Today, this same engagement continues to take place. However, with the outburst of master's and doctoral programs in recent history (i.e. over the past 100 years), it is no longer only the privately tutored and wealthy who have access to study materials. Further, technologies have advanced to a point where geographical location, or the university one studies at, should not detract from one's advancement. Rather, one's personal thoughtfulness and work ethic ought to be the determining factor.

As such, Philosophy Exchange represents an innovative forum for individuals to share arguments and ideas without the traditional physical boundaries that might otherwise impede academic progress. Through this forum, the following activities presently take place, or will take place in the future:

1. A repository to share pre-journal articles and ideas
2. A forum to exchange ideas and abstracts
3. A team of academics prepared to provide feedback on ideas
